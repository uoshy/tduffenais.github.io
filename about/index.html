			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>I went to Memorial University of Newfoundland and graduated with a degree in Computer Science. So far, I haven't worked in this field and all my previous positions were mainly customer service. Born in Stephenville and grew up in St. John's, so born and raised in Newfoundland. In my free time I enjoy hiking the various trails and forests of this beautiful island, learning seemingly useless information, and playing video games (among other things).</p>
